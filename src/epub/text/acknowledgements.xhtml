			<p>The stories in this book were collected on the unceded homelands of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations. This knowledge is foundational to any story of community and belonging in the place currently known as Vancouver.</p>
			<p>Vancouver Public Library would like to thank all the contributors whoâ€™ve lent their stories to this ongoing project, and the community groups who have welcomed us into their spaces. We look forward to the stories still to come.</p>
